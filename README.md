Scholarship Assist - Bridging the Gap for Out-of-State Students
Problem Statement
Students from other states often face significant challenges when applying for scholarships. These challenges include:

Unclear guidelines on eligibility and application processes.
Communication barriers with scholarship providers.
Difficulty in submitting essential documents, such as migration certificates or transfer certificates, required for scholarship applications in other states.
To ensure that all students, especially out-of-state students, have equal access to scholarships, we propose an innovative solution that streamlines the process of obtaining necessary documents and provides direct assistance through a chatbot for home-state students.

Solution Overview
This project addresses the needs of both out-of-state students and home-state students through a two-part solution:

Automated Document Authorization
For out-of-state students, we’ve developed a system that automates the generation and verification of critical documents like:

Migration Certificates
Transfer Certificates
These documents are essential for students applying to scholarships in states other than their own. By automating this process, we reduce the time and effort required for students to secure the necessary documentation for their scholarship applications.

Chatbot Assistance for Home-State Students
For students applying for scholarships within their home state, we’ve built a user-friendly chatbot that assists in:

Answering questions related to scholarships.
Providing guidelines and eligibility requirements.
Assisting with the submission of documents and troubleshooting any issues.
